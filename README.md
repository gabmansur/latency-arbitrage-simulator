# Latency Arbitrage Simulator

Welcome to the Latency Arbitrage Simulator! A playful yet powerful simulation project which Im designing to explore and analyze latency arbitrage strategies in electronic trading environments. Say its a personal lab for understanding how tiny time differences can drive profit in fast-paced financial markets

## Purpose
This project simulates how latency arbitrage works, where traders exploit small delays in market data across exchanges to execute faster trades and lock in profits. Especially relevant in high-frequency trading (HFT), and more broadly in the wild world of crypto where MEV bots, sandwich attacks, and frontrunning shenanigans are part of your daily breakfast (been there, done that ðŸ¤¡)

As someone who's dabbled in the degenerate jungle of shitcoin trading, I know first-hand the heartbreak of slow fills and slippage that eats your soul. This simulator is my nerdy revenge: a way to model, visualize and outsmart the latency gods (suck it, Jaredfromsubway)

Weâ€™ll explore:

- How microseconds can separate winners from bagholders
- Simulating synthetic latency across multiple exchanges
- Designing agent-based strategies that react fast (like, really fast)
- Logging and visualizing trade outcomes, decision speed and PnL curves

## Project Roadmap
Here's how the simulation will evolve over time. Each phase introduces additional realism, complexity, and fun:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Set up repo with `poetry`, `pyproject.toml`, clean file structure
- [ ] Simulate two exchanges with artificial latency using `SimPy`
- [ ] Create agents that can detect and act on arbitrage opportunities
- [ ] Lose my mind and question my whole existance at 2am
- [ ] Output trades, latencies, and results to dataframes

### Phase 2: Visualization + Analytics
- [ ] Add visualizations with `plotly` & `streamlit`
- [ ] Real-time dashboard showing trade activity, PnL, latency gaps
- [ ] Metrics around win/loss rate, execution speed, and opportunity frequency

### Phase 3: Strategy Experiments
- [ ] Add parameter tuning (latency gaps, strategy thresholds)
- [ ] Compare passive vs. aggressive arbitrage approaches
- [ ] Add exchange simulation variance (jitter, downtime)

### Phase 4: ML Exploration (Pray I reach this phase)
- [ ] Use simple ML models to predict latency windows
- [ ] Adaptive agents that tweak strategy based on past performance

## Tech Stack

##  Why This Project?
I created this as part of a tailored application to demonstrate my skills in simulation modeling, trading systems, and creative problem solving. Itâ€™s a way to shocase my passion (obsession?) with building it from scratch, asking questions, spiralling occasionally, and designing things that are beautiful and insightful. Itâ€™s my version of a digital playground. Somehow I still manage to work out 6 days a week...
